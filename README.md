# Osteoporosis-Risk-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Osteoporosis affects millions, especially older adults and postmenopausal women. Early diagnosis prevents fractures, but DXA scans are often limited. This project builds a machine learning CDSS that predicts osteoporosis risk using demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data to support early screening and better decisions.
